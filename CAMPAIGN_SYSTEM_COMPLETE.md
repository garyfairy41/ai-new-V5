# AI Call Center Campaign System - Production Ready üöÄ

The AI Call Center campaign and auto-dialer system is now **fully functional and production-ready**! This document provides everything you need to get started.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### Backend API (server.js)
- **Campaign CRUD** - Create, read, update, delete campaigns
- **Lead Management** - Add, import, export, and manage leads
- **Auto-Dialer Engine** - Start, pause, stop campaign dialing
- **Analytics & Reporting** - Campaign statistics and performance metrics
- **Webhook Integration** - Twilio call status and campaign updates
- **Health Monitoring** - System status and monitoring endpoints

### Database Schema
- **campaigns** - Campaign metadata and configuration
- **campaign_leads** - Lead data and call status
- **campaign_calls** - Call logs and analytics data
- All tables include proper RLS policies and indexes

### Auto-Dialer Engine
- **Multi-campaign support** - Multiple campaigns can run simultaneously
- **Intelligent queuing** - Manages lead priority and retry logic
- **Real-time status** - Live campaign and dialer monitoring
- **Error handling** - Robust error recovery and logging

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /workspaces/ai-new-V6/packages/server
npm install
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
# Required for basic operation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-domain.com
WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://your-domain.com:12001
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Required for auto-dialer
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number

# Optional
PORT=12001
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
```

### 3. Set Up Database Tables
```bash
# Create all required tables
node create-all-tables.js

# Create campaign-specific tables (if needed)
node create-missing-campaign-tables.sql
```

### 4. Start the Server
```bash
# Start the AI Call Center server
npm start

# Or start with specific environment
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

### 5. Test the System
```bash
# Run comprehensive API tests
node test-campaign-api.js

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:12002/health
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Create a Campaign
```javascript
POST /api/campaigns
{
  "profile_id": "user-uuid",
  "name": "Sales Outreach Campaign",
  "description": "Q4 sales outreach to warm leads",
  "agent_id": "agent-uuid",
  "caller_id": "+1234567890"
}
```

### Import Leads
```javascript
POST /api/campaigns/{campaignId}/import-leads
{
  "leads": [
    {
      "phone_number": "+1987654321",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "john@company.com",
      "company": "Acme Corp"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Start Auto-Dialer
```javascript
POST /api/campaigns/{campaignId}/start
// Response: { "success": true, "campaignId": "...", "status": "active" }
```

### Monitor Campaign
```javascript
GET /api/campaigns/{campaignId}/stats
// Returns real-time statistics, active calls, completion rates, etc.
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Auto-Dialer Settings
The auto-dialer can be configured per campaign:
- **maxConcurrentCalls** - Maximum simultaneous calls (default: 1)
- **callTimeoutSeconds** - Call timeout duration (default: 30)
- **retryAttempts** - Max retry attempts per lead (default: 3)
- **dialingInterval** - Time between dialing cycles (default: 5000ms)

### Campaign Configuration
- **agent_id** - AI agent to use for calls
- **caller_id** - Phone number to call from
- **schedule** - Campaign scheduling (future feature)
- **filters** - Lead filtering criteria (future feature)

## üõ†Ô∏è Production Deployment

### 1. Server Configuration
- Use a reverse proxy (nginx) for HTTPS termination
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
- Configure environment-specific variables
- Set up auto-scaling for high-volume campaigns

### 2. Database Optimization
- Monitor query performance
- Set up database backups
- Configure connection pooling
- Monitor storage usage

### 3. Security Considerations
- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all input data
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Secure webhook endpoints

### 4. Monitoring & Alerts
- Set up health check monitoring
- Monitor active dialer instances
- Track campaign performance metrics
- Alert on system failures

## üß™ Testing

### Run API Tests
```bash
# Test all campaign endpoints
node test-campaign-api.js

# Test specific functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:12002/api/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"profile_id":"test","name":"Test Campaign"}'
```

### Test Auto-Dialer (Safe Mode)
```bash
# Create test campaign with test phone numbers
# Use Twilio test credentials to avoid real charges
# Monitor logs for proper operation
```

## üìû Integration with UI

The backend is fully compatible with the UI components:
- **CampaignFormModal** - Uses campaign CRUD endpoints
- **LeadListModal** - Uses lead management endpoints  
- **AutoDialerControlsModal** - Uses dialer control endpoints
- **CampaignAnalyticsModal** - Uses analytics endpoints

All UI services should work out-of-the-box with this backend.

## üéâ Success!

‚úÖ **Complete CRUD Operations** for campaigns and leads  
‚úÖ **Functional Auto-Dialer** with real-time control
